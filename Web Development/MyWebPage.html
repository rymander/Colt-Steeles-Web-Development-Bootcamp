        <p> <b>Dogs</b> are man's best friend. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over
            15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
            expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet
            that
            would be inadequate for other canids.</p>

        <p>
            The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
            attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such
            as
            hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and
            aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the
            humanâ€“canine
            bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
            "man's best friend".[14]
